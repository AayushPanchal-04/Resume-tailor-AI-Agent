# 📄 Resume Tailor Agent

An AI-powered application that automatically optimizes your resume to match any job description using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This intelligent agent analyzes job descriptions and rewrites your resume to highlight relevant skills, experience, and keywords while maintaining authenticity. Built as part of my AI learning journey - Day 11 of exploring AI agents and LangChain!

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Resume Optimization**: Automatically tailors your resume to match job requirements
- **ATS-Friendly**: Optimizes for Applicant Tracking Systems with relevant keywords
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Provides detailed insights on what changed and why
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit web interface
- **Secure**: API keys stored securely in environment variables
- **Download Option**: Export your tailored resume instantly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Advanced language model for resume optimization
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Basic understanding of Python

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Install requirements

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-openai streamlit python-dotenv
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control!

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run resume.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input**: Paste your current resume and target job description
2. **Analysis**: AI analyzes the job requirements and identifies key skills
3. **Optimization**: Resume is rewritten to emphasize relevant experience
4. **Output**: Get a tailored, ATS-optimized resume ready for submission

### Technical Flow

```python
User Input → LangChain Prompt Template → OpenAI GPT-4o-mini → Optimized Resume
```

The app uses:
- `ChatPromptTemplate` for structured prompts
- `ChatOpenAI` for LLM integration
- `StrOutputParser` for response processing
- LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) chains for workflow

## 🎓 What I Learned

- Building AI agents with LangChain
- Prompt engineering for specific tasks
- Integrating LLMs into web applications
- Managing API keys securely
- Creating user-friendly AI interfaces
- Chain-based LLM workflows

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are stored in `.env` file (never hardcoded)
- `.env` is included in `.gitignore`
- User data is not stored or logged
- All processing happens in real-time

## 💰 Cost Estimation

Using GPT-4o-mini:
- ~$0.01-0.05 per resume tailoring
- $5 credit = ~100-500 resume optimizations
- Very affordable for personal use

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'`
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-openai
```

### Error: `insufficient_quota`
- Add credits to your OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)

### Error: `UnicodeDecodeError` in `.env` file
- Recreate `.env` file with UTF-8 encoding
- Ensure no BOM (Byte Order Mark)
